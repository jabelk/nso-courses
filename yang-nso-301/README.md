## High Level Design

> Note: the concepts should be taught in active learning, with student using NSO to visualize the different Yang features in the CLI / GUI, and build their own simple models with packages (not services, but packages with simple data models).

The student will understand:


- Working with NEDs (20%)
  - using leafrefs to point to configuration in a device stored in the CDB, with multiple examples for different yang statement types (leaf, leaf-list, etc.)
  - identifying gaps in the data model in NSO, so support can add 
- Hands on Exercises with all the data types from 201 ()
  - Give the student a prompt or scenario and ask them to write a data model. 
  - Give a suggested solution, but point out the general things it should have to be right
  - Have the data model be compiled into a package and play with inputs, seeing inputs fail.
